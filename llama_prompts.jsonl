{"prompt": "What is AHIL?", "completion": "AHIL is a programming language that runs exclusively on computers running on the Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. AHIL is an 
acronym that stands for Auto Helm Intermediate Language. It is a simple language that is used for basic automation tasks. It is a programming language where all code
 is run sequentially. AHIL programs are commonly referred to as workflows, writting a workflow means to write a program using AHIL code"}

{"prompt": "How does AHIL work semantically? What does the basic langiage structure look like?", "completion": "There are NO user-defined functions, classes, objects, 
if statements, or variables. AHIL code is used in order to complete simple tasks, often interacting with the Windows GUI, and making some API calls handling tasks behind the scenes. Each line of code represents a 
differnt function call, from the pre-defined syntax. Only the pre-defined functions from the syntax described can be used. Users have control over the parameters used 
with the functions provided by AHIL. There are no comments in AHIL code, so no in-code explanations/comments are ever made. All keywords and function names begin with 
capital letters. Each new function is seperated by a new line. A function parameter is seperated from a function keyowrd by a single space. In the case of multiple 
parameters being provided to a function, each parameter value after the first parameter will be seperated by a space."}

{"prompt": "in AHIL, SwitchWindow is a function which will switch which window is currently active. It will switch to an open application window with the title that is

{"prompt": "in AHIL, Run is a function that will open a .exe application, or a file on one's computer with the default application for that file's extension. The 
function's paramerter will either be the name of the application's exe file (with the .exe extension), or the full Windows path to a file on one's computer. The

any string wrapped in double quotes.", "completion": "Write \"This is a sample sentence that is typed out on screen.\""}

{"prompt": "in AHIL, PressKey is a function that will click one individual key on the keyboard. It takes in a parameter of the key to press, wrapped in double quotes.
It also supports clicking functional keys with the use of modifiers. Modifier rules are summarized as follows: modifiers for different keys and actions. The exclamation mark (!) is used for the Alt key, with {Alt} representing the Alt key, {Alt Down} for pressing it down, and {Alt Up} for releasing it. The plus sign (+) is associated with the Shift key, and the syntax includes {Shift}, {Shift Down}, and {Shift Up} for Shift key events. The caret (^) signifies the Ctrl key, with options like {Ctrl}, {Ctrl Down}, and {Ctrl Up} for Ctrl key actions. The hash (#) is used for the Windows key, and options include {LWin}, {RWin}, {LWin Down}, and {RWin Down} for Windows key events. Braces ({ }) enclose key names and other options, and are used for sending special characters literally. Additionally, there are representations for function keys ({F1} - {F24}), state keys (CapsLock, ScrollLock, NumLock), control keys (Control, Alt, Shift), mouse events, numpad keys, browser navigation keys, media and launch keys, special keys, and modifiers for key remapping such as {Blind} and {Raw} for literal interpretation.",

a list of statements that are then repeated a specified number of times. The parameter for a For loop is an integer, that represents the number of times the statements 
within the for loop are repeated. There must be a space between the word \"For\" and the number, that is wrapped in brackets. After the number wrapped in brackets,
there will be a set of curly braces that will hold the set of fucntions to be repeated. As is the case with other statements in AHIL, the functions wrapped in the
