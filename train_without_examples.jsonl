{"text": "<s>[INST] What is AHIL? [/INST] AHIL is a programming language that runs exclusively on computers running on the Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. AHIL is an acronym that stands for Auto Helm Intermediate Language. It is a simple language that is used for basic automation tasks. It is a programming language where all code is run sequentially. AHIL programs are commonly referred to as workflows, writting a workflow means to write a program using AHIL code </s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] How does AHIL work semantically? What does the basic langiage structure look like? [/INST] There are NO user-defined functions, classes, objects, if statements, or variables. AHIL code is used in order to complete simple tasks, often interacting with the Windows GUI, and making some API calls handling tasks behind the scenes. Each line of code represents a differnt function call, from the pre-defined syntax. Only the pre-defined functions from the syntax described can be used. Users have control over the parameters used with the functions provided by AHIL. There are no comments in AHIL code, so no in-code explanations/comments are ever made. All keywords and function names begin with capital letters. Each new function is seperated by a new line. A function parameter is seperated from a function keyowrd by a single space. In the case of multiple parameters being provided to a function, each parameter value after the first parameter will be seperated by a comma and space. For functions that specify they require coordinates as part of their parameters, The assumption is that coordinate (0,0) represents the top left of the screen, and the x and y values increase rightwrds and downwards. There are no negative numbers for these coordinates.  </s>"}

It takes in a parameter of the key to press, wrapped in double quotes.It also supports clicking functional keys with the use of modifiers. Modifier rules are summarized as follows: modifiers for different keys and actions. The exclamation mark (!) is used for the Alt key, with {Alt} representing the Alt key, {Alt Down} for pressing it down, and {Alt Up} for releasing it. The plus sign (+) is associated with the Shift key, and the syntax includes {Shift}, {Shift Down}, and {Shift Up} for Shift key events. The caret (^) signifies the Ctrl key, with options like {Ctrl}, {Ctrl Down}, and {Ctrl Up} for Ctrl key actions. The hash (#) is used for the Windows key, and options include {LWin}, {RWin}, {LWin Down}, and {RWin Down} for Windows key events. Braces ({ }) enclose key names and other options, and are used for sending special characters literally. Additionally, there are representations for function keys ({F1} - {F24}), state keys (CapsLock, ScrollLock, NumLock), control keys (Control, Alt, Shift), mouse events, numpad keys, browser navigation keys, media and launch keys, special keys, and modifiers for key remapping such as {Blind} and {Raw} for literal interpretation.

Both of these path parameters must be the full path, including the name of the file to be moved with the extension at the end. This function can also be used to rename a file, simply by changing the name of the file in the second parameter at the end (a differnt one from what was originally passed). When the file names are kept the same in both parameters, it will just execute a simple move. If they are different, it will move the file to the new location and change the name. Changing file names with this function can also allow a user to change the file type, simply by changing the file extension at the end of the second path.

There must be a space between the word \"For\" and the number, that is wrapped in brackets.
